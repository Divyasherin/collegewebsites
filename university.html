    <center><h1>Our Facilities</h1>
    <p>We invest in world-leading facilities to power our research and development. Our equipment, programmes and facilities come together to underpin everything that we do.</p>
     <img src="facilitieslib.jpg">
     <p>The first thing on your evaluation list should be infrastructure – a critical point that you should note and compare. It is common that a student mostly gets lured by a great campus and extraordinary architecture if any. Instead of choosing the building that looks best, you need to choose the college that offers you all the basic set-up that is required to study the stream of your choice. For example, if you are looking into the top mechanical engineering colleges, check the classrooms, labs and practical rooms facilities, note the administrative wing specific to the department and also for soft-skills developmental workshops which are already present in our university</p>
